<li><a href="4/fpe.html">First-person engine</a>.  I worked through
<a href="http://www.playfuljs.com/a-first-person-engine-in-265-lines/">Hunter
Loftis's great tutorial</a>.  The credit is his, apart from any
mistakes I've introduced!

<li><a href="calculator.html">Calculator</a>.  Handles simple
calculations, not well tested, and doesn't handle exceptions properly.
An exercise in playing with buttons.

<li><a href="life_slider.html">Game of Life</a>: uses jQuery and
jQuery UI to add a slider plus a few other elements.

<li><a href="life_d3.html">Game of Life</a>, implemented using D3.
